#### My thoughts on the process
This project was a HUGE step up from the previous ones... and I found it incredibly challenging in the best way. I was finding that I would go to bed after finishing a section and have a hard time sleeping because all I could think of is what I could improve on. Unfortunately while working on this sprint, I had a medical issue pop up and this sprint took me longer than I was hoping for.
